# Swift Strings

A small library of String utilities for the Swift programmer. This is my first attempt to create a github based package for use with the Swift Package Manager.

### Overview:

* Character View: convert character view to string and count characters
* Wackbards: reverse string
* Ranges: use integer ranges with strings
* NSString mimicking: rangeOfString, componentsSeparatedByString
* Decomposition: first, last, butFirst, butLast, car, cdr, just, at, except
* Subscripting: subscripting with get/set with integer subscripting
